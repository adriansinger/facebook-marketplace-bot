This first part of ths script will scrape queried item from Facebook marketplace and store scraped data in a MySQL table. The second portion is used to access, manipulate, and analyze the scraped data. Several use cases for this project could be to find the lowest or average price of a product in the second-hand market over a period of time to identify the best deals, or to understand the volume of an item being sold on the second-hand market.

This project is a work in progress. The script for scraping marketplace is based on a project by Keenan Burke-Pitts (https://gist.github.com/Kiwibp).
